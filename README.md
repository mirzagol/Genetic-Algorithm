# Genetic Algorithm Symbolic Regression

## Overview

This project demonstrates a simple **genetic algorithm** for symbolic regression using Python. The algorithm evolves mathematical expressions (function trees) to fit a set of data points generated by a hidden "black box" function.

## Features

- **FunctionTree** class for representing and evaluating mathematical expressions as binary trees
- Genetic operators: **crossover** and **mutation**
- Fitness function based on mean squared error (with penalty for division by zero)
- Example: Evolving expressions to fit the function `f(x) = 2x + 3`

## How It Works

1. **Population Initialization:** Random function trees are generated.
2. **Fitness Evaluation:** Each tree is evaluated on the dataset; fitness is the negative sum of squared errors.
3. **Selection:** The best individuals are selected.
4. **Crossover & Mutation:** New trees are created by swapping subtrees and mutating nodes.
5. **Iteration:** Steps 2â€“4 are repeated for a number of generations.
6. **Result:** The best evolved function is printed.

## Usage

1. Open `Untitled.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or VS Code.
2. Run all cells to execute the genetic algorithm.
3. The best evolved function will be printed at the end.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- Jupyter Notebook (recommended for interactive use)

## Example Output

```
The best function found is: ((x * 2) + 3)
```

## Notes

- The project uses a custom `Node` class for tree nodes (ensure it is defined in your notebook).
- The algorithm is basic and can be improved with more advanced genetic programming techniques.
